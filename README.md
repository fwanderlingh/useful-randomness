# useful-randomness

A personal collection of utilities.

0. eclipsePreferences: for easy bootstrap of a new installed eclipse
0. FUTILS: C++ library with little helpful functions that I use repeatedly
0. myBash.rc: bash.rc already modified with all the usual edits I use to do in a fresh linux install
