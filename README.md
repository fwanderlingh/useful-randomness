# useful-randomness

A personal collection of utilities.

**1.** eclipsePreferences: for easy bootstrap of a new installed eclipse with my usual mods

**2.** FUTILS: C++ library with little helpful functions that I use repeatedly

**3.** myBash.rc: bash.rc already modified with all the usual edits I use to do in a fresh linux install
